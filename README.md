# CTest Action

Test [CMake](https://cmake.org/) projects using [CTest](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/chapter/Testing%20With%20CMake%20and%20CTest.html) on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

This action wraps the [`ctest`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html) command for testing CMake projects.
It provides a better syntax for specifying test options compared to calling the `ctest` command directly.

By default, this action invokes `ctest` with the `--output-on-failure` and `--no-tests=error` options set. These options are configured to display the output only in case of failure and to prevent this action from testing a project that lacks any tests.

## Available Inputs

| Name | Value Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `test-dir` | path | Specifies the directory in which to look for tests. It defaults to the `build` directory. |
| `build-config` | string | Choose the configuration to test. |
| `tests-regex` | Regex pattern | Run tests matching regular expression. |
| `args` | Multiple strings | Additional arguments to pass during the CTest run. |

> **Note**: Multiple strings mean that the input can be specified with more than one value. Separate each value with a space or a new line.

> **Note**: All inputs are optional.
